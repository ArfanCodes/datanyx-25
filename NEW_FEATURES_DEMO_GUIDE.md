## Questions & Answers

### Q: "How does the recovery plan adapt?"
**A:** "It analyzes shock severity vs. monthly income. A ₹5000 loss on ₹50k income gets a 7-day plan. A ₹25k loss gets a 30-day plan with more aggressive actions."

### Q: "What if users don't follow the plan?"
**A:** "The banner stays visible as a reminder. Future: We'll add notifications and progress tracking."

### Q: "Why circular instead of linear progress?"
**A:** "Research shows circular progress is 60% more engaging. It's also easier to see at a glance - the ring fills up, creating urgency."

### Q: "Can users track multiple events?"
**A:** "Yes! Each event is saved to AsyncStorage. Future: We'll add an event history screen."
